## Overview

This website hosts the project `IN104 MiniWolfram`, which is a simplified version of the Wolfram Alpha
engine. WolframAlpha is an engine that provides answers to queries and performs computations.
Your task involves developing a calculator capable of executing fundamental operations like addition, subtraction,
multiplication, etc.

Once these core functions are operational, you are encouraged to enhance the calculator by integrating additional
features of your choice.
