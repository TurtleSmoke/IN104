## Overview

This website hosts the IN104 course project MiniWolfram, which is a simplified version of the Wolfram Alpha
engine. Your task involves developing a calculator capable of executing fundamental operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

Once these core functions are operational, you are encouraged to enhance the calculator by integrating additional
features of your choice.

To get started, read the [first step](project/first-step) and the [project guidelines](/project/description).
