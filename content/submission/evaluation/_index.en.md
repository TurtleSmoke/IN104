The assessment of the project will depend on both the quality of the code and the accompanying report.

## Report

Your report should comprehensively cover all aspects of your project. Explain and justify the choices you made
throughout the project, including architecture, algorithms, data structures, and any other pertinent areas. Detail the
challenges you encountered and how you resolved them. It's crucial to be explicit about each specific feature you
implemented. If I do not see the feature in the report, I may not play with your code properly, and you may not get the
points you deserve.

Your report should be well-structured and clear. It can be written in either French or English and should not exceed 5
pages in length (excluding figures and references).

## Code

The overall quality of your code will be a significant factor in evaluation. Below are some guidelines to enhance your
code quality (not an exhaustive list, but a good start):

- Ensure functions and variables have meaningful names.
- Use comments if necessary, but strive to write self-explanatory code.
- Focus on readability and comprehension, avoiding excessively long functions. (Not having a single function with 1000
  lines of code is a good start).
- Indentation and formatting should be consistent and ideally follow the language's best practices.
- Organize your code in a logical and modular manner.
- Remove dead code and unused variables to keep the codebase clean.
- Add a `.gitignore` file to avoid pushing unnecessary files to the repository.
- Keep only the necessary files in the GitHub repository (e.g., no `.o` files, no executables, etc.).

Obviously, your code **must** compile and run without errors!

Moreover, it's important to properly "wrap" your code, which includes (but is not limited to) the following:

- Implementing testing (unit tests, functional tests, etc. with or without a framework).
- Leveraging auxiliary tools such as linters and formatters for code quality.
- Maintain a clean commit history that reflects the evolution of your project.
- Including instructions in the README file to help understanding the project. You may
  refer to some examples of excellent README files for
  inspiration [here](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)
- Great usage of GitHub features such as issues, pull requests, and project boards.
