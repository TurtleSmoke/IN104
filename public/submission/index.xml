      <description>The assessment of the project will depend on both the quality of the code and the accompanying report.
Report Your report should comprehensively cover all aspects of your project. Explain and justify the choices you made throughout the project, including architecture, algorithms, data structures, and any other pertinent areas. Detail the challenges you encountered and how you resolved them. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to be explicit about each specific feature you implemented. If I do not see the feature in the report, I may not play with your code properly, and you may not get the points you deserve.</description>
